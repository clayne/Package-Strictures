Package::Strictures

Often, I find myself in a bind, where I have code I want to do things
properly, so it will detect of its own accord ( at run time ) misuses of
varying data-structures or methods, but the very same tools that would
be used to analyze and assure that things are going correctly, result in
substantial performance penalties.

This module, and the infrastructure I hope builds on top of it, may
hopefully provide an 'in' that lets me have the best of both worlds,
fast on the production server, and concise when trying to debug it (
that is, not having to manually desk-check the whole execution cycle
through various functions and modules just to find which level things
are going wrong at ).

In an ideal world, code would be both fast and concise, however, that is
a future fantasy, and this here instead aims to produce 80% of the same
benefits, but now, instead of never.
